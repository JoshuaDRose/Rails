<h2>Formatting</h2>
The code formatting that can be found within this test package is, in addition to the references in the documentation strings,
consistent with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">pep8</a> style guides and is linted with <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8#readme">
flake8</a>, both of which are up to date style guides.<br>
Additionally, this repository follows <a href="https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53">
github community guidlines</a> for reasons of consistency and multilateral styling.<br>
<br>

<sup>*</sup><i> Although this might be the case, discrepancies may occur from time to time, as commit messages, pull requests and 
issue titles are not moderated or linted for formatting errors.</i>
