<h2>Formatting</h2>
The code formatting that can be found within this test package is, in addition to the references in the documentation strings,
consistent with pep8 style guides and is linted with flake8, both of which are up to date style guides. Additionally,
this repository <i>loosely</i> follows (community commit guidelines)[https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53] for reasons of consistency and multilateral styling.
